# Text Editor Search

This is a project for my university class "Data Structures and algorithms - Practicum".
It represents a program, which according to a given text and multiple queries, for each query finds the number of occurrences of the searched word / phrase in the text and the positions of them. For this sake, it uses "suffix array" data structure.
